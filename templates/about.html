        “For us, music has above all a transcendental significance. It disengages the spiritual from the happenings of
        life; it sings of the relationships of the human soul with the soul of things beyond. The world by day is like
        European music; a flowing concourse of vast harmony, composed of concord and discord and many disconnected
        fragments. And the night world is our Indian music; one pure, deep and tender raga. They both stir us, yet the
        two are contradictory in spirit. But that cannot be helped. At the very root nature is divided into two, day and
        night, unity and variety, finite and infinite. We men of India live in the realm of night; we are overpowered by
        the sense of One and Infinite. Our music draws the listener away beyond the limits of everyday human joys and
        sorrows, and takes us to that lonely region of renunciation which lies at the root of the universe, while
        European music leads us a variegated dance through the endless rise and fall of human grief and joy.”</p>
